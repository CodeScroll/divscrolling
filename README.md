# divscrolling
A simple jQuery scrolling for representation type web page. After a search i see that i have to load and read strange, ~ big libraries for achieve a "per div scroll". So i write a piece of code to implent this". You can add more divs but you need to add the divs id to sections variable.

Otherwise you can collect the ids with preferred way of class selection like $('.scrolldiv').each(function(){ sections.push($(this).attr('data-id'));});
